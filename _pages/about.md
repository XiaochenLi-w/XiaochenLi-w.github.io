I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Virginia, working with Prof. [Tianhao Wang](https://tianhao.wang). Prior to this, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at University of Virginia from April 2023 to April 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Cyberspace Security from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhanqin). I received my B.S. degree in Information Security from China University of Mining and Technology. I also collaborated closely with Dr. [Weiran Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0w_EKL0AAAAJ&hl=en) (from Alibaba Group) and Prof. [Yuan Hong](https://yhongcs.github.io/) (from University of Connecticut) during my Ph.D. journey.
My recent research interests focus on Differential Privacy and Machine Unlearning.
